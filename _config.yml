  - name: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
    events:
    - 1938: >-
        <b>Isidor Isaac Rabi</b> first detects the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the underlying principles used in MRI,
        in a beam of lithium chloride through a complex experimental procedure 
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.53.318" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Link to original paper)</a>.
    - 1946: "<b>Felix Bloch</b> & <b>Edward Mills Purcell</b> extend the work done by <b>Rabi</b> by developing new methods for obtaining precise measurements
    from nuclear magnetization in solids and liquids. Bloch & Purcell shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work in 1952."
    - 1971: >-
        <b>Raymond Damadian</b> shows MR relaxation time could be used to distinguish cancer from healthy tissue, being the first to identify 
        the clinical use of NMR <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.171.3976.1151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Link to original paper)</a>.
    - 1973: >-
        <b>Paul C. Lauterbur</b> develops the theory for MRI by proposing the use of magnetic field gradients to encode spatial information 
        from the NMR signal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/242190a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Link to original paper)</a>. 
        He recieved the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2003 jointly with <b>Peter Mansfield</b>.
    - 1974: "<b>Damadian</b> designs and builds the first full-body MRI machine, called 'Indomitable'."
    - 1977: >-
        <b>Damadian</b>, <b>Larry Minkoff</b>, and <b>Michael Goldsmith</b> perform the first MRI scan on a live animal to visualize a tumour
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1006309" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Link to original paper)</a>, 
        and MRI body scan of a human <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/270722a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Link to original paper)</a>.
    - 1977: >-
        <b>Peter Mansfield</b> invents an MRI acquisition method that makes scan times suitable for clinical use, called echo planar imaging (EPI)
        <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3719/10/3/004" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Link to original paper)</a>. 
        He recieved the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2003 jointly with <b>Lauterbur</b>.
    - 1978: "<b>Damadian</b> found FONAR corporation, which produced the first commercially available MRI machine in 1980."
    - 1986-1987: "<b>Charles Dumulin</b> & <b>Howard Hart</b> develop MR angiography, where vasculature can be imaged using MRI. 
    Additionally, <b>Denis Le Bihan</b> obtained the first diffusion MR images."
    - 1990: >-
        <b>Seiji Ogawa</b> recognizes deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin have different magnetic properties, and discovered the technique that
        underlies functional MRI (fMRI) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.87.24.9868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Link to original paper)</a>.
    - 2012: >-
        Animal studies are performed using a magnet strength of 21.1 Tesla <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jmr.2012.05.016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Link to original paper)</a>.
    - 2019: >-
        For the first time, human studies were performed using a magnet strength of 10.5 Tesla
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fmrm.28093" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Link to original paper)</a>.
    - 2020: "Hyperfine protable MR imaging system becomes the first FDA approved portable MRI system capable of providing neuroimaging at the 
    bedside, eliminating the need for patients to be moved to a specialized MR suite."
